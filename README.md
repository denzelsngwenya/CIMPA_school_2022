# CIMPA_school_2022

This repository contains codes of the Centre International de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées (CIMPA) school which was held at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Capetown South Africa 2022. These are part of the training on Deep Generative Methods taught by Prof Steve Kroon (Stellenbosch University). I will be explaining the mathematical foundations of Deep generative methods and writing codes to solve the challenges that were put to us in the school.
